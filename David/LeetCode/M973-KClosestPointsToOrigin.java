Description:
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the
order that it is in.)

Solution:
*Note that you can solve this in the same fashion as M347, but that is O(n log k) fashion,
select sorting will solve it in O(n).
