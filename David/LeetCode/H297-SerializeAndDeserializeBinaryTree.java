Description:
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so
that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link
to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can
be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Solution:


Runtime:

Space Complexity:

*/

public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {

    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {

    }
}
