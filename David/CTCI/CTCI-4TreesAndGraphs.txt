4.1 Route between nodes
Run BFS from both nodes, and if they both touch the same node, return true. If BFS ends and they
don't touch, then there is no route.

Or just run BFS and see if the other node is in the visited list.

4.2 Minimal Tree
Get the middle as the root, and then run the function on the left and right side, with the resulting
trees being the left and right children. (Recursive)

(see E108-ConvertSortedArrayToBST) and (M109-ConvertSortedListToBST)
